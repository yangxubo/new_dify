**Dify** is an LLM application development platform that has helped built over **100,000** applications. It integrates BaaS and LLMOps, covering the essential tech stack for building generative AI-native applications, including a built-in RAG engine. Dify allows you to **deploy your own version of Assistants API and GPTs, based on any LLMs.**

## Use Cloud Services

[Dify.AI Cloud](https://dify.ai) provides all the capabilities of the open-source version, and includes 200 free requests to OpenAI GPT-3.5.

## Why Dify

Dify is model-agnostic and boasts a comprehensive tech stack compared to hardcoded development libraries like LangChain. Unlike OpenAI's Assistants API, Dify allows for full local deployment of services.

| Feature | Dify.AI | Assistants API | LangChain |
|---------|---------|----------------|-----------|
| **Programming Approach** | API-oriented | API-oriented | Python Code-oriented |
| **Ecosystem Strategy** | Open Source | Closed and Commercial | Open Source |
| **RAG Engine** | Supported | Supported | Not Supported |
| **Prompt IDE** | Included | Included | None |
| **Supported LLMs** | Rich Variety | Only GPT | Rich Variety |
| **Local Deployment** | Supported | Not Supported | Not Applicable |

## Features

![](./images/models.png)

**1. LLM Support**: Integration with OpenAI's GPT family of models, or the open-source Llama2 family models. In fact, Dify supports mainstream commercial models and open-source models (locally deployed or based on MaaS).

**2. Prompt IDE**: Visual orchestration of applications and services based on LLMs with your team.

**3. RAG Engine**: Includes various RAG capabilities based on full-text indexing or vector database embeddings, allowing direct upload of PDFs, TXTs, and other text formats.

**4. Agents**: A Function Calling based Agent framework that allows users to configure what they see is what they get. Dify includes basic plugin capabilities like Google Search.

**5. Continuous Operations**: Monitor and analyze application logs and performance, continuously improving Prompts, datasets, or models using production data.

```bash
cd docker
docker compose up -d
```

After running, you can access the Dify dashboard in your browser at [http://localhost/install](http://localhost/install) and start the initialization installation process.

### Helm Chart

A big thanks to @BorisPolonsky for providing us with a [Helm Chart](https://helm.sh/) version, which allows Dify to be deployed on Kubernetes.
You can go to https://github.com/BorisPolonsky/dify-helm for deployment information.

### Configuration

If you need to customize the configuration, please refer to the comments in our [docker-compose.yml](docker/docker-compose.yaml) file and manually set the environment configuration. After making the changes, please run `docker-compose up -d` again. You can see the full list of environment variables in our [docs](https://docs.dify.ai/getting-started/install-self-hosted/environments).
